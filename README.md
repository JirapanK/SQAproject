# OPENLearn

OPENLearn is a social cataloguing platform that offers users the ability to explore the plethora of Massive Open Online Courses.  The database includes courses from Coursera's API. The decision to user Coursera's API was made as it offers over 900 courses spanning a diverse range of subjects. 

On OPENLearn, users can filter for courses by category, by session length, and by the number of hours they are willing to dedicate to coursework. Via the search results, users can explore details of each course such as the course format, the course description, and the prerequisites. They are provided an external link to join the course. 

If users are interested in a course, but perhaps aren't interested in joining it right away, they can bookmark it, for later viewing. 

A fun feature of the app is the Randomize tab. If users are unsure of what course they want to take, they can also hit the Randomize button resulting in a suggestion for a random course. 

The app has real world applications as it attempts to reduce the high attrition rate af123``
